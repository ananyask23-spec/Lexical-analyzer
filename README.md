# Lexical-analyzer
A Lexical Analyzer is a program that converts a stream of characters from a C source file into a sequence of tokens such as keywords, identifiers, operators, literals, and symbols. It prepares input for the next compilation stage and handles errors like invalid characters, malformed tokens, and unterminated strings during tokenization.
